## Common Pitfalls in Healthcare OKRs

### Compliance vs. Innovation Balance
**Problem**: Focusing only on regulatory requirements without innovation
**Solution**: Balance compliance goals with improvement and innovation targets

**Poor Example**: "Maintain 100% regulatory compliance"

**Better Example**: "Achieve 100% regulatory compliance while improving patient satisfaction by 20%"

### Volume vs. Value Metrics
**Problem**: Emphasizing quantity over quality of care
**Solution**: Include both access and outcome measures

**Poor Example**: "Increase patient volume by 30%"

**Better Example**: "Increase patient volume by 20% while maintaining quality scores above 90th percentile"

### Departmental Silos
**Problem**: Creating OKRs that don't consider interdisciplinary care
**Solution**: Include cross-functional collaboration and care coordination

**Poor Example**: "Reduce nursing turnover by 15%"

**Better Example**: "Improve care team satisfaction and reduce combined turnover by 15%"

### Ignoring Patient Voice
**Problem**: Internal metrics without patient perspective
**Solution**: Include patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction measures

**Poor Example**: "Reduce length of stay by 10%"

**Better Example**: "Optimize length of stay while maintaining patient satisfaction scores above 4.5/5"
