## Conversation Strategies

### Getting the Most from Your Session

#### 1. Start with Context
**Poor Example**:
"Help me create OKRs for marketing."

**Better Example**:
"I'm the marketing director at a B2B SaaS company with 50 employees. We're in our third year, just raised Series A, and need to scale from $2M to $5M ARR this year. Our main challenge is lead quality - we get volume but low conversion rates."

#### 2. Be Specific About Metrics
**Poor Example**:
"We want to improve customer satisfaction."

**Better Example**:
"Our current NPS is 6.8, CSAT is 4.2/5, and we have a 4% monthly churn rate. Customer support tickets have increased 40% but resolution time is up to 48 hours."

#### 3. Share Constraints Openly
**Poor Example**:
"We want to grow revenue significantly."

**Better Example**:
"We want to grow revenue from $2M to $5M, but we only have budget to hire 3 new people and our sales cycle is typically 6 months. We also need to maintain our current gross margin of 80%."

#### 4. Ask for Industry Context
**Good Questions**:
- "What's typical for companies our size in this industry?"
- "How do our competitors usually measure this?"
- "What are the industry benchmarks we should consider?"
- "Can you show me examples from similar companies?"

### Effective Communication Patterns

Use the **STAR method** for context:
- **Situation**: Current business state and market conditions
- **Task**: What you need to achieve and why
- **Action**: Resources and approaches available

#### Asking Questions
**Strategic Questions**:
- "How does this align with our overall strategy?"
- "What's the competitive advantage this creates?"
- "How will this impact other team objectives?"

**Tactical Questions**:
- "How should we measure this in practice?"
- "What's a realistic timeline for this target?"
- "What could prevent us from achieving this?"

**Learning Questions**:
- "What makes this a strong key result?"
- "How do successful companies typically approach this?"
- "What variations should we consider?"

## Example Conversation Excerpts

### Effective Context Setting
**User**: "I'm the VP of Product at a fintech startup. We have 12 engineers and launched our MVP 6 months ago. We have 500 active users but our retention rate is only 60% after 30 days. We need to prove product-market fit to raise Series A in Q4."

**Agent Response**: "Thanks for that context! Retention is critical for fintech. Let's focus on improving that 60% rate while building toward Series A readiness. Tell me about your current user journey - where do you see the biggest drop-offs?"

### Good Metric Discussion
**User**: "We want to improve developer productivity, but I'm not sure how to measure it without creating perverse incentives."

**Agent Response**: "Great concern! Let's explore both output and outcome metrics. Instead of just code lines, we could look at feature delivery velocity, bug rates, and developer satisfaction. What matters most to your business outcomes?"

### Effective Refinement
**User**: "The key result 'Increase revenue by 30%' feels too generic."

**Agent Response**: "You're right! Let's make it more specific to your business model. Since you're subscription-based, we could break this down into new customer acquisition (MRR from new customers: $50K), expansion revenue (upsells: $30K), and churn reduction (save $20K MRR). Does this align better?"
