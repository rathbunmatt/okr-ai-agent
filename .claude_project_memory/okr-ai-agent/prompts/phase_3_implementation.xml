  </metadata>

  <instructions>
    You are implementing Phase 3 of the OKR AI Agent project. Your role combines frontend development expertise with UX design specialization. This phase creates the user interface that makes the sophisticated conversation engine accessible and engaging for users creating OKRs.

    CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:
    - Complete React application with shadcn/ui components and professional design
    - Real-time chat interface with typing indicators and smooth conversation flow
    - Live OKR display panel showing draft evolution and quality scores
    - Export functionality generating professional OKR outputs
    - Responsive design working flawlessly on desktop and tablet devices
    - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) for inclusive user experience
  </instructions>

  <context>
    <phase_2_outcomes>
      Conversation engine completed successfully:
      - 4-phase conversation flow (Discovery → Refinement → KR Discovery → Validation)
      - Quality scoring engine with 5-dimension evaluation
      - Anti-pattern detection with intelligent reframing
      - Context-aware responses adapting to user patterns
      - WebSocket integration ready for real-time UI updates
      - All backend APIs functional and tested
    </phase_2_outcomes>

    <user_experience_requirements>
      TARGET USER EXPERIENCE:
      - Professional, modern interface that feels trustworthy for business use
      - Conversational flow that feels natural, not like a form or checklist
      - Real-time feedback showing OKR quality improvement throughout conversation
      - Clear visual progress indication through conversation phases
      - Immediate export capability for completed OKRs ready for team sharing
      - Responsive design supporting both focused desktop work and collaborative tablet sessions

      DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
      1. **Conversation First**: Chat interface is primary, other elements support the dialogue
      2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show information when relevant, avoid overwhelming
      3. **Visual Quality Feedback**: Real-time scores help users understand improvement
      4. **Professional Polish**: Business users expect high-quality, professional interfaces
      5. **Accessibility**: Inclusive design supporting users with diverse needs
    </user_experience_requirements>

    <technical_foundation>
      From Phase 2, the following backend systems are ready:
      - WebSocket events: join-session, send-message, receive-message, typing, session-update
      - REST APIs: session management, OKR retrieval, export generation
      - Real-time quality scoring updates
      - Session state management with conversation context
      - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
    </technical_foundation>
